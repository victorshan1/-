# Asset Routing And Truth / 资产路由与事实约束

Use this reference before final prompt writing when the source is more than a single article sentence: a book, story, report, chart, slide, screenshot, science topic, historical object, brand, or social-card package.

Circuit Workers is a visual reasoning system, not only a style. The first question is not "what should it look like?" but "what job must this image do in the final artifact?"

## Core Rule

Keep the circuit worker only when the worker's physical action clarifies the meaning.

If the final need is an exact chart, a full slide layout, a full social card, a logo, or a decorative center image where no action is needed, do not force Circuit Workers to own the whole job. Use Circuit Workers for the reasoning image, and let the surrounding layout, chart, PPT, or card system do its own work.

## Asset Roles

Pick one role before choosing the scene.

### Article Figure

Use for one section, claim, tension, or turn inside an essay.

- Visual job: make one argument memorable.
- Best form: one worker performing one relation.
- Text ownership: short component labels inside the image; paragraph explanation stays outside.
- Rule: the worker must physically perform the relation; if removing the worker weakens nothing, do not use one.

### Story Or Book Card

Use for a whole story, chapter, biography, case study, or book explainer.

- Visual job: compress characters, turning points, consequence, and transformation.
- Best form: one dense single-image multi-beat card, unless the narrative truly needs a series.
- Text ownership: labels for beats, characters, forces, or choices; no plot paragraphs inside the image.
- Rule: worker reveals, guides, archives, illuminates, or transforms the story arc — the worker's action IS the narrative engine, not decoration.

### Data Story Scene

Use when the content includes numbers, rankings, benchmark results, project metrics, or a chart screenshot, but the final image should explain the meaning rather than replace a rigorous chart.

- Visual job: show what the data means and why it matters.
- Best form: a compact gauge or display module embedded in a PCB scene, with the worker inspecting, comparing, highlighting, or routing the key metric.
- Truth rule: list every value that appears in the image. Do not let the image model invent numbers, categories, dates, or axes.
- Rule: if exact axes and values are the whole artifact, use a native chart or PPT/chart workflow instead; Circuit Workers can create the surrounding interpretation scene.

### Center Illustration For A Card Or Slide

Use when another system will handle title, subtitle, body copy, platform ratio, or slide layout.

- Visual job: be the central image well.
- Best form: no large title inside the image; leave safe margins and avoid dense text.
- Text ownership: only labels needed to understand the components. Outer layout owns headline and commentary.
- Ratio: ask for the target image well if known; otherwise default to 16:9 horizontal.

### Reference-Informed Explainer

Use for science, history, culture, geography, specific brands, model families, artifacts, devices, species, buildings, or anything visually easy to get wrong.

- Visual job: make the thing recognizable without copying an external image.
- Best form: symbolic PCB scene with stable visual cues translated into the Circuit Workers world.
- Reference rule: gather stable cues, not style. Use references to avoid wrong parts, wrong era, wrong mechanism, or confused silhouettes.
- Record uncertainty when exactness matters.

## Routing Questions

Answer these before prompt writing:

```text
asset role:
final container: article / README / social card / slide / doc / knowledge base / other
display well or ratio:
text ownership: inside image / outside layout / both
truth constraints: exact labels / exact numbers / historical or scientific cues / brand cues / none
reference need: yes/no and why
worker necessity:
if not Circuit Workers, better owner:
```

## Truth Constraint Enforcement (v2.1 — eval fix)

Truth constraints are not optional. Each constraint must be:

1. **Explicit**: Written as a verbatim item in the prompt, not implied.
2. **Complete**: Every label, number, entity name, or relationship from the user's input must appear as a constraint.
3. **Verbatim**: Use the user's exact wording. Do not paraphrase or "improve" terminology.

### Pattern

For a user request mentioning services A, B, C with compensation actions:

```text
Truth constraints:
- The image must contain exactly these labels: "A", "B", "C" (verbatim from user input)
- A must show its compensation action: [exact action from user text]
- B must show its compensation action: [exact action from user text]
- C must show its compensation action: [exact action from user text]
- No additional services or labels may be invented
```

### Common Failure

When truth constraints are vague (e.g., "show the services and their compensation"), the image model invents labels or omits required elements. When constraints are explicit and verbatim, the model has no room to improvise.

This is an eval-tested requirement: evaluators check that every entity, label, and relationship from the user's input appears in the generated image.

## Cognitive Anchors For Long Sources

For a long article, chapter, book, transcript, report, or deck, do not illustrate every paragraph.

Pick 1–6 cognitive anchors:

- the opening question
- the main transformation
- the central tradeoff
- the hidden mechanism
- the evidence or data turn
- the emotional or moral choice
- the closing payoff

For each anchor, decide whether it becomes:

- one standalone figure
- one panel in a story/book card
- one image in a chained series
- a data story scene
- no image because text explains it better

## Truth Handling

Some images can be approximate; some cannot.

### Must Be Exact

- gauge values and display module readings
- labels specified by the user
- names, dates, places, product names, model names
- scientific pin labels and component designators
- historical route labels when they carry the point
- brand or icon cues when recognition matters

Put exact requirements explicitly in the final prompt:

```text
Exact text: include only these labels: "A", "B", "C".
Exact data: show these values and no others: A=12, B=8, C=5.
Do not invent extra categories, dates, axes, legends, or labels.
```

PCB example: if the article says "latency dropped from 200ms to 50ms", the gauge display must show those exact numbers — not a generic "low latency" badge.

### Can Be Symbolic

- mood and emotional temperature
- circuit-board props and metaphor world
- worker pose and LED state
- visual emphasis and lighting
- non-critical background components

PCB example: a warm amber LED glow to convey "effort" is symbolic; it does not need to match a real LED wavelength.

## What To Refuse Or Reroute

Reroute away from Circuit Workers when:

- the user only needs a strict chart with exact axes and values
- a screenshot or table already explains the point better
- the circuit worker would be decorative — no action clarifies the meaning
- the asset is a complete social card or slide layout rather than the center illustration
- the topic requires photo-real documentary accuracy
- the user needs a logo, icon system, sticker, or brand mark

In these cases, say the better owner plainly: native chart, PPT skill, social-card skill, code-rendered diagram, image edit, or ordinary documentation.

## QA Additions

Before delivery, check:

- The chosen asset role is visible in the result.
- Text ownership is respected: no headline stuffed into the image when an outer layout should own it.
- Exact labels and data are not invented, misspelled, or swapped.
- Reference-informed cues are recognizable but not copied from a source image.
- The worker action is still necessary after routing.
- The image remains readable at the intended display size.
